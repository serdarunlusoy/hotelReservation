3.1
We are building our system "outing" by using Three Tier architectural style.

Three tier architectural system consists of 3 layers which are Presentation,Function and Storage respectively from higher to lower.

Presentation layer is the interface for client.It contains forms and pages which are at the top level.

Function layer is at middle.It manipulates the data which comes from database.

Storage layer is the lowest layer and contains the database.
