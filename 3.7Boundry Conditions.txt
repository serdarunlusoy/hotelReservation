3.7 Boundary Conditions

When system first initiated a registration page comes up and the first user signs up as Admin.

Thus system should not be initiated publicly at first.

Then Admin adds registrant by hand.

After these steps system starts functioning normally which means main page starts being displayed at first.

Since the system is a webpage it's available 24/7.

System is only shutted down when a maintanence is needed.While maintanance is on going system displays a related message and cant be used.

Since all the data is saved on a web server in case of a failure the protocol's of the web server are applied.
